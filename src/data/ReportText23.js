    <h3>Final Energy Consumption – 2021 data</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>Eurostat data for Final Energy Consumption (FEC) 2021 show a strong increase of energy demand after a sharp drop in 2020. FEC is almost back to the level of 2016 and well above the 2020 EU-wide target.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>This development confirms our last year’s assumption that the 2020 figures were not a result of energy efficiency improvements, but due to exceptional circumstances in the Covid year 2020 (e.g. drop in mobility and economic activity and warm weather).</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>At global level, the IEA observed a continued weak improvement of energy intensity in 2021 of 0.5%, at even lower level as in 2020 when it was at 0.6%. For 2022, the IEA expects again higher levels of energy intensity improvements worldwide (2%). However, this is due to consumer behavior in reaction to the high energy prices, rather than structural efficiency improvements. An increase in energy intensity improvement of 4% is deemed necessary to meet energy and climate goals. (see <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-2022/executive-summary" target="_blank">www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-2022/executive-summary</a>)</p>

    <h3>Final Energy Consumption in households – 2021 data</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>The trend of energy consumption in households (climate corrected) in the EU since 2005 is slightly downwards (around 0.25% pa). However in 2021, FEC in households in absolute figures increased again to 261.8 Mtoe in the EU 27 total, back to the level as in 2012. When applying the climate correction – 2021 had a rather high amount of heating degree days –, 2021 shows a strong decrease in the household FEC compared to the Covid year 2020, to the level in 2017.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The strong increase in energy consumption in households during 2020 can be considered exceptional. The 2021 level was impacted by high energy prices at the end of the year leading to energy savings in households.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>An analysis of FEC in households over the last 20 years by Enerdata/Odyssee-Mure reveals a slowing down of the decrease of energy use after 2014 until 2019 (see <a href="https://enerdata.net/publications/executive-briefing/households-energy-efficiency.html" target="_blank">enerdata.net/publications/executive-briefing/households-energy-efficiency.html</a>) due to increased space and water heating demand. The Eurostat data for 2020 and 2021 suggest that energy efficiency improvement in households remains weak. A downward trend in energy consumption in households as necessary to achieve climate goals has not yet started.</p>

    <h3>Renewables share in household FEC – 2021 data</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>Data for renewables share in household FEC without biomass can be used as a proxy for buildings specific decarbonisation of the heating systems. It includes solar thermal, geothermal and ambient heat. Photovoltaic production and consumption on-site is not included in the available Eurostat data.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>Renewables share in household FEC is increasing rapid and steady since 2005, in particular without biomass (around 15% increase pa), but at very low level.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>In 2021 the share including biomass stood at 21.2%. Without biomass, the share is at 3.8% in EU average, largely diverging between countries. Some Nordic and central European countries display high levels of renewable share stemming from biomass, drastically dropping when the latter is deduced: (Denmark: 24.2%/6.2%, Sweden: 11.8%/0.1%; Finland 31.8%/10.5%/, Estonia: 40.2%/0%, Latvia: 38.5%/0%, Lithuania:31.9%/3.6%, Poland: 24.4%/2%, Hungary 21.1%/0.5%, Romania 37.1%/0%, Bulgaria:31.8%/0.5%).</p>

    `
    <h3>Energy poverty – 2021 data</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>The dashboard is using two indicators, both from SILC surveys, as a proxy for energy poverty:</p>
    `,
    `
    <ul><li>Population living in a dwelling with a leaking roof, damp walls, floors or foundation, or rot in window frames or floor; and </li><li>Population unable to keep home adequately warm by poverty status.</li></ul>
    `,
    `
    <p>In 2021, 7% of EU population were unable to keep home adequately warm. This figure decreased again after a small increase in 2020 for a first time after several years of constant decline. 2021 figures for EU population living in bad housing conditions are still not available (March 2023).</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>In October 2022, the EU Energy Poverty Advisory Hub launched <a href="https://energy-poverty.ec.europa.eu/observing-energy-poverty/national-indicators_en" target="_blank">a new dashboard on energy poverty</a>, using 21 indicators in order to catch the many facets and reasons for energy poverty in Europe. In March 2023, the EPAH published <a href="https://energy-poverty.ec.europa.eu/about-us/news/practical-guide-energy-poverty-diagnosis-access-our-new-handbook-2023-03-02_en" target="_blank">a practical guide</a> on how to diagnose energy poverty.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>A <a href="https://www.odyssee-mure.eu/publications/policy-brief/measuring-energy-poverty.pdf" target="_blank">policy brief by Odyssee-Mure from April 2022</a> provides insights in energy poverty and measures taken in EU member states. It finds an energy poverty divide across Europe, with highest energy poverty in South-Eastern European states and some Southern and Central European States.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>A further increase in energy poverty can be expected for 2022 due to raising energy prices over 2021 achieving record levels after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

    <h3>Limiting use of fossil fuel in buildings</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>The use of fossil fuels in buildings has to be phased out to achieve 2050 climate goals. ECOS is monitoring national regulation on this topic.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The <a href="https://www.coolproducts.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ECOS-Coolproducts-Background-Briefing-MS-ambition-to-phase-out-fossil-fuel-heating.pdf" target="_blank">ECOS briefing from July 2021</a> shows that in 2026, more than half of the EU population (~222 500 000 inhabitants) will live in a country that has either entirely or partially phased out fossil fuel heating. Front-runners in this field are Denmark, Sweden, The Netherlands, France, Ireland and Austria.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has increased pressure to move away from importing fossil fuel from Russia. In this context and to increase supply security, the fuel switch in heating is ever more urgent and might lead to an acceleration of new regulation.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>A new website <a href="https://betterwithoutboilers.eu/" target="_blank">Better without Boilers</a> is mapping national policies to phase out fossil fuels from heating of buildings.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>Sales of heat pumps have strongly accelerated in reaction to uncertainty of gas supplies. The European heat pumps association (EHPA) is now <a href="https://www.ehpa.org/2022/12/15/ehpa_news/which-countries-are-ending-fossil-fuel-heaters/" target="_blank">monitoring the legislation on fossil fuel heaters</a>.</p>

    `
    <h3>Credibility of renovation strategy (placeholder)</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>The dashboard aims at displaying the credibility of the national renovation strategies, taking into account the following three dimensions: 1) increasing energy efficiency of the existing building stock, 2) availability of funding and financing tools and 3) tackling energy poverty.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The renovation strategies are to be found in the Long-Term Renovation Strategies (LTRS, required by the EPBD, Article 2a) due for 20 March 2020 and in the National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRP) that Members States had to submit by April 2021.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>However, nor the LTRS nor the NRRP provide a basis for an assessment of the credibility of the renovation strategy. Analyses by the European Commission, BPIE, Renovate Europe and E3G, Housing Europe are available. They provide insights in best practice and available funding for the Renovation Wave. The review of the NRRPs concludes that there is a risk that investments via the NRRP are ‘falling off a cliff’ after their ending in 2026, instead of creating the renovation markets needed to make buildings ready for a Net-Zero-Emission future.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p><u>Outlook:</u> The Fit for 55 package is expected to create a more appropriate legislative framework for a strategic approach to achieve the 2030 and 2050 goals for the buildings sector. An update of the NECPs and new Building Renovation Plans (replacing the current LTRSs) are due for June 2024.</p>
    `,
    `
    <h3>Ambition level on energy efficiency (FEC)</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>The Commission found that the cumulative impact of the NECPs for energy efficiency (FEC) would sum up to 29.4%, falling short of the current target of 32.5% set in the Energy Efficiency Directive.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p><u>Outlook:</u> The Energy Efficiency Directive is about to be recast, including a higher EU-wide energy efficiency target. The recast also aims at an improved governance mechanism in order to avoid an ambition gap in the future.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>Updated draft National Energy and Climate Plans (including establishing national contributions to achieve the EU wide EE target) are due for June 2023, final NECPs due for June 2024.</p>
