  `This dashboard monitors progress of buildings across the EU 27 Member States towards the 2050 net-zero GHG emissions goal. It has a focus on the structural drivers of GHG emissions in residential buildings, which represent 75% of the buildings stock. To achieve the EU climate goals, it is key to progress in energy renovations of homes.`,
  `The dashboard shows the development of key energy and policy parameters since 2005 and will be regularly updated over the coming years. This should normally happen in January, when Eurostat publishes new energy data.`,
  `Data on buildings are scarce. Those on renovation rates and depths are not systematically collected. The latest figures stem from a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/1.final_report.pdf"></a>report published by the European Commission in 2019 and are based on a survey reflecting the situation by 2016. What about energy performance certificates? Not available as well – they are neither standardised nor are data collected at national or EU level.`,
  `Therefore, final energy consumption (FEC) data are the central parameter of this dashboard, as they are closely linked to the EU’s energy efficiency target and the energy efficiency of buildings and thus the overall energy performance of buildings. Data on energy use are based on market data. They are collected systematically, are robust and regularly updated. FEC data, both total and in households, are complemented by a set of additional indicators (quantitative and qualitative ones) which allow to draw a detailed picture of the situation and progress in the sector. The data are lagging by roughly two years, the delay of publication by Eurostat. Qualitative indicators are based on studies or assessments by the European Commission or credible players in the sector.`,
