    <h3>Final Energy Consumption – 2020 data</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>Eurostat data for Final Energy Consumption (FEC) 2020 show a sharp drop in energy consumption for 2020. Therefore, the 2020 EU-wide energy efficiency target was met. However, this is not the result of improved energy efficiency efforts, but due to the exceptional circumstances in 2020. Covid response measures resulted in a drop in mobility and economic activity, which impacts energy demand. Furthermore, 2020 was a very warm year with a low energy consumption for heating.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>Worldwide, the IEA observes a strong decline in the improvement of energy intensity in 2020.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p><u>Outlook:</u></p>
    `,
    `
    <p>For 2021, the IEA expects again higher levels of energy intensity improvements worldwide. Yet, they remain largely below what is needed to meet energy and climate goals. (see <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-2021/executive-summary" target="_blank">iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-2021/executive-summary</a>).</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>Next updates: October 2022 (2021 data on FEC) and June 2023 (estimates 2022 data on FEC)</p>
    `,
    `
    <h3>Final Energy Consumption in households – 2020 data</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>FEC in households have steadily decrease over the last two decades. In 2020, FEC in households in absolute figures remained at 242.8 Mtoe in the EU 27 total, at exactly the same level as in 2019. When applying the climate correction – 2020 had a low amount of heating degree days –, 2020 shows a strong increase in the household FEC. This can partly be explained by home working and therefore a more intensive use of residential buildings.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>While the increase in energy consumption in households during 2020 can be considered exceptional, the further development of the indicator has to be monitored carefully. An analysis of FEC in household over the last 20 years by Enerdata/Odyssee-Mure reveals a slowing down of the decrease of energy use after 2014 (see <a href="https://www.enerdata.net/publications/executive-briefing/households-energy-efficiency.html)" target="_blank">enerdata.net/publications/executive-briefing/households-energy-efficiency.html</a>).</p>

    `,
    `
    <h3>Renewables share in household FEC – 2020 data</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>Data for renewables share in household FEC without biomass can be used as a proxy for buildings specific decarbonisation of the heating systems. It displays solar thermal, geothermal and ambient heat. Photovoltaic is not applicable in these statistics as defined by Eurostat.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>Renewables share in household FEC including biomass was at 20.3% in 2020, slightly down from the previous year. Without biomass, the share is at 3.3% in EU average, largely diverging between countries. Some Nordic and central European countries display high levels of renewable share stemming from biomass, drastically dropping when the latter is deduced: (Denmark: 24%/5.5%, Sweden: 12%/0.1%; Finland 31%/9.5%/, Estonia: 42%/0%, Latvia: 41%/0%, Lithuania:34%/1.9%, Poland: 25%/1.8%, Hungary 22%/0.4%, Romania 38%/0%, Bulgaria:36%/0.5%). </p>

    `
    <h3>Energy poverty – 2020 data</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>The dashboard is displaying two indicators, both from SILC surveys, as a proxy for energy poverty:</p>
    `,
    `
    <ul><li>Population living in a dwelling with a leaking roof, damp walls, floors or foundation, or rot in window frames or floor; and </li><li>Population unable to keep home adequately warm by poverty status.</li></ul>
    `,
    `
    <p>In 2020, in average, 14% of the EU population lived in bad housing conditions, while 8% were unable to keep home adequately warm. The latter figure increased for a first time after several years of constant decline.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p><u>Outlook:</u></p>
    `,
    `
    <p>An estimated 50 million households in the European Union (EU) live in energy poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the situation as, in addition to financial constraints, lockdowns have led to an increase in energy consumption. A policy brief by Odyssee-Mure from July 2021 provides an overview of the extent to which energy poverty affects the EU and how it is addressed by the Member States (see <a href="odyssee-mure.eu/publications/policy-brief/european-energy-poverty.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.odyssee-mure.eu/publications/policy-brief/european-energy-poverty.pdf</a>).</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>A further increase in energy poverty is expected for 2021 and 2022 due to raising energy prices over 2021 achieving record levels after the Russian invasion into Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>Next update: November 2022 (SILC data 2021)</p>

    `
    <h3>Limiting use of fossil fuel in buildings</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>In order to achieve climate goal, the use of fossil fuels in buildings has to be entirely phased out. ECOS is monitoring national regulation on this topic.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The ECOS briefing from July 2021 shows that in 2026, more than half of the EU population (~222 500 000 inhabitants) will live in a country that has either entirely or partially phased out fossil fuel heating. Front-runners in this field are Denmark, Sweden, The Netherlands, France, Ireland and Austria.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p><u>Outlook:</u></p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The Russian invasion to Ukraine has increased pressure to move away from importing fossil fuel from Russia. In this context and to increase supply security, the fuel switch in heating is ever more urgent and might lead to an acceleration of new regulation.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The indicator is regularly updated as soon as new information becomes available.</p>
    `,
    `
    <h3>Credibility of renovation strategy (placeholder)</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>The dashboard aims at displaying the credibility of the national renovation strategies, taking into account the following three dimensions: 1) increasing energy efficiency of the existing building stock, 2) availability of funding and financing tools and 3) tackling energy poverty.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The renovation strategies are to be found in the Long-Term Renovation Strategies (LTRS, required by the EPBD, Article 2a) due for 20 March 2020 and in the National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRP) that Members States had to submit by April 2021.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>However, nor the LTRS nor the NRRP provide a basis for an assessment of the credibility of the renovation strategy. Analyses by the European Commission, BPIE, Renovate Europe and E3G, Housing Europe are available. They provide insights in best practice and available funding for the Renovation Wave. The review of the NRRPs concludes that there is a risk that investments via the NRRP are ‘falling off a cliff’ after their ending in 2026, instead of creating the renovation markets needed to make buildings ready for a Net-Zero-Emission future.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p><u>Outlook:</u></p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The Fit for 55 package is expected to create a more appropriate legislative framework for a strategic approach to achieve the 2030 and 2050 goals for the buildings sector. An update of the NECPs and new Building Renovation Plans (replacing the current LTRSs) are due for June 2024.</p>
    `,
    `
    <h3>Ambition level on energy efficiency (FEC)</h3>
    `,
    `
    <p>The Commission found that the cumulative impact of the NECPs for energy efficiency (FEC) would sum up to 29.4% and thus fall short of the current target of 32.5% set in the Energy Efficiency Directive.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p><u>Outlook:</u></p>
    `,
    `
    <p>The Energy Efficiency Directive is about to be revised, including a higher EU-wide energy efficiency target. The recast also aims at an improved governance mechanism in order to avoid an ambition gap in the future.</p>
    `,
    `
    <p>Updated draft NECPs (including establishing national contributions to achieve the EU wide EE target) are due for June 2023, final NECPs due for June 2024.</p>
